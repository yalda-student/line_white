# line_white_signup_mobile

A basic Flutter project.

## About this repo
A simple application with splash screen, sign up and sign pages. new users can upload profile photo from gallery and register with email or phone number. All of these information will be stored in shared preferences. After registering, application goes to main page and user can see their information with profile photo.
In main page user can logs out or delete their account, by choosing delete account user's information deleted from shared preferences but if they choose log out, they can log in again.I also developed auto login feature for the existing user.
